**Introduction** <br>
Coursera is an amazing educational website that offers numerous online courses to students. I myself have completed few courses from it and was curious to see which were the most popular courses in the website.

**Objective** <br>
In this project I have scraped the data from the coursera website to gather the neccesary information for each course offered on the website. I have then applied machine learning tools to predict the completion percent for each course based on the information collected. Following questions will be answered from the analysis- <br>
1) Course with the highest enrollments.<br>
2) Course with highest ratings.<br>
3) Estimating the course with highest completion percents.<br>
4) Relationship between ratings and completion percent.<br>
5) Developing a predictive model about the completion percent.<br>

I tried to compare this data with other educational websites like Edx and Udacity. However Edx and Udacity do not show the rating for each course or the number of people who have rated it (atleast not that I am aware of).

**Additional Work to be added'**
Categorize the courses into differnet groups (like business, data science, computer science etc) to see if some categories have higher completion rates than others. 

Scrap enrollment information from Edx websites for comparison.
