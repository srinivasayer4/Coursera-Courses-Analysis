# Coursera-Courses-Analysis
In this project I have scraped the data from the coursera website to gather the neccesary information for each course offered on the website. I have then applied machine learning tools to predict the completion percent for each course based on the information collected. Following questions will be answered from the analysis- 1) Course with the highest enrollments. 2) Course with highest ratings. 3) Estimating the course with highest completion percents. 4) Relationship between ratings and completion percent. 5) Developing a predictive model about the completion percent.
